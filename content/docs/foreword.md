<strong>"<em>Every generation has underestimated the potential for finding new ideas. We consistently fail to grasp how many ideas remain to be discovered.</em>" â€” Paul Romer</strong>

My first immersion in the banking world dates back to 2002, when I helped develop a CRM web application for Commonwealth Bank of Indonesia. At that time, the web was still in its infancy; features were rudimentary, standards were evolving, and best practices were scarce. We had no choice but to learn at lightning speedâ€”prototyping, experimenting, and adapting on the fly. That experience taught me an essential lesson: progress in the banking sector often depends on embracing nascent technologies before they become mainstream.

<p style="text-align: justify;">
My second pivotal encounter with banking came in 2004, when I was tasked with porting a DOS-based branch application at Bank Central Asia (BCA) from DOS to Windows. The complexity was profoundâ€”there were no source codes to reference, and the back-end architecture relied on mainframe CICS systems that were far removed from the typical Windows environment. It was clear that deep research, collaboration, and iterative problem-solving were the only ways to navigate the multifaceted challenges. This journey underscored the importance of strong technical foundations, as well as the value of creative thinking in modernizing legacy systems without sacrificing performance or reliability.

Fast-forward to 2022, and I had the privilege of advising on the establishment of Jago Digital Academy at Bank Jago, at a time when AI was beginning to accelerate dramatically. We find ourselves today on the threshold of an era that stretches from Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) to the prospect of Artificial Superintelligence (ASI). The ramifications for banking are enormousâ€”touching every aspect from customer service and fraud detection to regulatory compliance and core operational processes. In this climate of rapid change, bankers and technologists must remain perpetually curious and agile.

<p style="text-align: justify;">
It is against this backdrop that I welcome this book as a significant milestone for Bank Mandiri in transforming IT from a purely operational role into a strategic force. Remarkably, this book itself exemplifies the cutting edge by being generated through AI, with human-in-the-loop author validation. Such a blend of technology and human insight points toward a broader shift, one in which emergent applicationsâ€”ranging from AI-driven analytics and agents to decentralized blockchain servicesâ€”will reshape bankingâ€™s future.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Yet the power of these technologies goes beyond mere automation or efficiency. They stand to redefine what was previously considered impossible, opening doors to products, services, and experiences that defy conventional limits. Blockchain, AI, and eventually quantum computing each harbor the potential to disrupt established paradigms, forging entirely new avenues for growth and value creation. Banks that fail to prepare for these transformations risk becoming relics in a landscape dominated by nimble competitors.

<p style="text-align: justify;">
To thrive, institutions must cultivate internal innovation capacities rather than rely exclusively on external vendors. Strengthening in-house R&D ensures that banks can tailor solutions to precise needs, sustain intellectual property, and respond more swiftly to evolving market dynamics. This book deftly argues that core competenciesâ€”both human and technologicalâ€”are the linchpin of survival in a hyper-competitive global market.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
I trust that reading these pages will spark a sense of urgency and possibility. The philosophical underpinnings presented herein encourage you to rethink old assumptions, while the practical frameworks serve as guideposts to implement transformative changes. Ultimately, it is my hope that this work will inspire you to see your IT department not as a cost center, but as a strategic collaboratorâ€”one that fuels innovation, drives customer delight, and secures a prosperous future for your bank in the era of AI and beyond.
